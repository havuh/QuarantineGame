# Quarantine Game
QuarantineGame is a game created for the Programming II course in the Software Engineering program. The objective of the game was to raise awareness within the community about the use of masks, compliance with social distancing obligations, and to provide recommendations to avoid infections. Additionally, the goal was for us students to apply our knowledge of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) in the development of the solution.
